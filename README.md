# Horiseon-Code-Base

HTML &amp; CSS code for the Horiseon website. 

HTML initially had one link that did not work that has since been corrcted. 

HTML file also did not follow proper accessibility standards, so "alt" tags were added to all images on the site. 

Semantic tags, along with concise comments were added to the HTML to more easily describe the code structure.

Condensed redundant CSS classes together to reduce number of needed lines.

Made small changes to CSS attribute values so that the output more closely mirrored the demo image.

Please note that I ran into issues obtaining an accurate screen shot. Tools such as Chrome extension "GoFullPage" and "Webpage Screenshot" would not capture the image without some sort of loading error. I believe that the screenshot capture speed and the website load speed were directly at odds, creating a less-than-desireable image. What I have included is my best attempt to capture a screenshot at this time.
